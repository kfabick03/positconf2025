___

### 1.1 Background
* < use this space to provide business context and background for the project >
* < we recommend using bullets here to avoid a lengthy paragraph that is annoying to read >
* < this section is sometimes best completed by explaining your project to a technical colleague and noticing what details you choose to tell them (then noting them in here) >

### 1.2 Analytics Utilized
* < include technical algorithms or approaches that you may want to quickly be able to look up without having to read an entire readme >
* < the idea is that after you complete several projects, you sometimes know you used a certain technique or model for a project but you may forget the business name of the project. this section lets you quickly see what analytics you utilized if you are looking it up for reference on a new project. >
* < examples: random forest, mathematical optimization, ARIMA time series forecasting, etc >

### 1.3 Tools Utilized
* < list tools you used in this section. examples: R, Python, Streamlit, Posit Connect >
* < tool 1 >
* < tool 2 >

# 2. Technical Setup
___

### 2.1 Tool Versions Utilized
* < this could be combined with the 1.3 Tools Utilized section above, but we wanted the first section to be non-technical and the second section to be more technical >
* < tool name> < major.minor.patch >

### 2.2 Project-specific Pre-requisites (outside of CRAN/PyPi packages listed in requirements.txt)
* < if your project requires any unusual set up steps to make it run in the virtual environment list those here >
* < for mathematical optimizations, this might include needing to install an open-source solver like GLPK >
* < for projects requiring APIs, you might want to specify which API Keys are required and provide some guidance on how to set them up >

### 2.3 General Setup Guidelines
* < we have this section linked to some other documentation about how to install python/R at our company and how to create virtual environments. this may not be needed for your use cases. >
